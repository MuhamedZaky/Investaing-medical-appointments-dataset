# Project description
This project is based on a medical dataset for medical appointments in Brazil, the main purpose was knowing which patients characteristics have impact on their attending.
For the sake of that I asked some questions, wrangled, cleaned, then explored the data to answer it, I also added some visualizations along the way to make it easier to understand
The data was provided by udacity's classroom and the rest was done by me.
